Entering the gym was straightforward.I had a small travel bag and was told I couldn’t take it into the gym. I didn’t have a lock so couldn’t put it away so had to leave without getting a workout.

I won’t use the gym again because of this if I’m visiting so I wasted money.

That gym then showed on my app of available gyms. A few days later, I went to the gym and I was still locked out. Even the gym manager wasn't able to propose a better way to contact customer services. After another 36 hours I got another response and resulted in an upgrade to my membership. Not tried out any access at the gym yet..."

Unfortunately I was set up with a personal trainer who repeatedly cancelled on me with a couple hours notice, took days to reply to me. Set me up on an app and program I had to pay extra for but took weeks to give me access. Now currently refusing to refund me or carry out my outstanding sessions. Managers tell me there’s nothing they can do/will do to help me. Would struggle to trust a PT again now I’ve been robbed of £90."

They are professional and have a good physio knowledge. They were able to suggest classes and exercises that are suitable for my health conditions. This was a big plus for me.The website is pretty straight forward and easy to use. I just need to get used to the App and website and learn to navigate the classes and booking system.

Where to start...the gym constantly smells, the sanitiser station by the entrance has been empty for months, allowing guests to sanitise on entrance and entry is so simple to implement but would go such a long way! Soap dispenser and hand dryer has been broken in the men's changing room upon multiple visits... not even a temporary soap by the sink (I don't even want to think about how many germs are being transfered to the equipment.) Why are there only 6 benches in one of the busiest puregyms in London?? Don't even get me started on the locker situation, just look at the other reviews. You can say ""guests are recommended to bring a towel"" but the majority won't - there should be stations to sanitize equipment. If you want to boost your immune system - puregym woolwhich is the place to go!"

I’m not sure if it’s just my perception or if other women feel this way, but I find it a bit unprofessional when personal trainers give advice to clients and then go out on dates afterwards. Working out in revealing clothing adds to that feeling. However, maybe this is just how things are, and perhaps Pure Gym in Paisley stands by this approach. That’s my honest personal opinion."

On the down side, fre weights absolutely everywhere, not in order, no one re-wracks their weights. Poor gym decorum by some of the members. Teenagers messing around and being noisy.Frankly the gym has great potential but more staff need to be on sight to regulate tidyness and how some members behave. I paid for an £8 one day pass.

Even if they don't just bill me the extra 2 pounds in the next cycle. The way they address this is the worst possible way.

Greg's expertise in body recomposition shines through in his tailored approach. Thanks to his support and knowledge, I've not only achieved great results but also developed a genuine enthusiasm for fitness. If you're looking for a PT who delivers results while keeping workouts fun and engaging, Greg is the one!"

Jakub Wojciechowski,2025-03-11T21:37:21.000Z,1,Betrayal,I was offered a discount code which I applied and it was suppose to take my joining fee away and discount my monthly payment by 30% for 3 months and initially I was supposed to pay only £14.95 and once I went to the checkout I was still charged for the joining fee and my member ship price wasn't discounted. I payed for it regardless because I want to go gym however I feel very disappointed by the fact that I was offered something like this and it didn't work I tried refreshing the page multiple times before paying and restarted the membership application process multiple times but the result was still the same without the discount code being applied at the checkout. I just wish I could get atleast 50% refund for this transaction as I don't see this being a fault on my side.

After 6am it's extremely busy and it's very hard to complete a workout as most machines are in use, or someone is just sitting at the machine watching Facebook on their phones!!! But I have to say that I was extremely disappointed that there were water bottles left at pretty much every machine, throw them away, I don't understand why leave them there. As for the ladies toilets, there wasn't any toilet roll in 2 out of the three toilets, it was a mess in there. They have a cleaner who arrives at 6am when the gym is do busy and he is then hoovering in between the machines and where you're trying to work out. Do it earlier!!"

I have an expensive membership at what is meant to be a higher end gym, however, in my opinion, PureGym knocked it out of the park. The equipment was modern and extremely clean. Despite me being there at a busy time (from 4.30pm), machines were accessible and it was great to see so many squat racks, doubles of some of the most popular pieces of kit, etc. My usual gym doesn't have the likes of a push/pull sled, for example. A great experience all round. I'd move to PureGym in a shot if there was one convenient to me at home (Monifieth, just outside Dundee!)."

Matthew James,2025-03-07T22:08:30.000Z,3,Overrun With Children,"Gym is overrun with children under the age of 16 in the evenings. They are very obviously underage and several have told me they’re 12 and 14 years old, staff are aware yet do nothing to get them out. As a result they hog machines in clusters of 5 or 6 meaning no one else can use them, they mess around (running around, screaming and unsurprisingly act like children) and break equipment as a result. The gym has a real problem with multiple going into the entrance pods at the same time. Again staff are aware yet do nothing to stop it from happening, this makes a mockery of people who actually pay for their memberships. Classes are good, however sometimes start before the advertised start time meaning that on occasions I’ve turned up at the start time but can’t join as it’s already started. I’ve been going to this gym for about 4 years and there has been a dramatic decline in the last four months. Complaints raised are not followed up or given feedback."

Your update was truly eye-opening. That said, I’m at peace with it now and view this degenerate group with a fresh perspective—perhaps even with a bit of amusement.The PT we both identified as a bully is shockingly bad, isn’t she? Wow! She certainly made me feel uncomfortable on a number of occasions. Thank you so much for shedding light on her and the other staff. I feel much better now that I know about her past transgressions. She’s lucky I’m not the manager. I can’t mention her name again, as my review keeps getting flagged and removed. However, I’ll refrain from saying anything rude, keep this comment professional, and leave it at that. In the end, karma will catch up with them all."

You're through to Gabor, I can take a look at this for you.Please do Gabor as it’s not a good look for your company, quite frankly disgusting actually. As stated I only joined a few days ago and already looking to cancel membership and move to another gym.I'm sorry to see of all this! We have high standards at all PureGym’s and would like this to be investigated immediately. As this is an in-gym issue and we are not located at the gym, this will need to be raised with the Gym Manager. You can do this yourself as you will have the most information regarding the issue,  by sending an emai. If you`d wish I can cancel your membership and process full refund as a good will gesture.Basically they don’t care and it’s down to the customer to sort it out 👌🏻"

In another Puregym near me... Troy, Marcus and Rachel have also been very welcoming to a friend of mine that has started at another Puregym location in the region.A shout out also Kaylan who's the General/Gym Manager, and Cluster Manager who is ensuring I complete my onboarding with zero issues. So far so good. I'm very much looking forward to the process of commencing a progression plan.

Mark,2025-03-05T21:53:41.000Z,1,A Very Disappointing Start,"I understood the free 3 day pass to be 3 separate days. However, it is consecutive days. Not quite as useful as I'm sure most people won't want to go from no gym at all to going 3 days back to back.Also, I signed up at about 7.30 PM. I assumed that I could pick the start date, which would have been in a few days time. However, you picked the start date as this evening, when I can't go.As this is supposed to be promo I find this very disappointing and I haven't even been to the gym yet.You really should fix this.

Every exercise has both video and written explanation how to do it, and even a stopwatch ready, so it's like you already have your personal trainer in the app. Its really brilliant how thorough they went while making the app. Therefore, I really can't wait to see the gym and start working out in it! :-)"

Staff will actively listen to other members use slurs at you and tell you you're the problem. Rather than enforce their own rules they will tell you to find another gym. Horrid culture. Unpleasant to workout, they allow members to behave poorly then wonder why the police get called to diffuse tension created. Not safe"

Norman,2025-03-04T17:44:01.000Z,1,PureGym Hammersmith bathrooms eww,"PureGym Hammersmith seriously needs to step up its cleanliness, especially in the bathrooms. Every visit, the toilets are in a disgusting state unclean, often with no toilet paper, and a foul odor lingering in the air. The sinks are just as bad, with a constant unpleasant smell that makes washing your hands an ordeal. For a gym that prides itself on being accessible and well-maintained, the hygiene standards here are unacceptable. It’s disappointing, and management needs to address this immediately."

customer,2025-03-03T13:49:22.000Z,2,Disappointed and VERY dirty/ untidy.,"First time in this particular Pure Gym and it was VERY untidy and quite dirty. But, there were a wide range of machines and space to exercise with. However, there were weights left all around the gym, left on machine as well as machines like the Air bike and benches left in the way of the weights making it difficult to use them or even the space around it. There were a number of empty water bottles used tissues and blue roll left around the gym floor and on machines making it very uncomfortable to exercise in. Unfortunately, I didn't see any cleaning stations or bins other than in the changing room. The changing rooms smelt like a urinal and generally unclean with one of the doors off the cubical hanging on. - Could definitely use some basic hygeine attention!Overall, the wide variety of equipment was good although they were very basic and could do with updating. But the biggest thing for me was the poor level of cleanliness that let it down drastically. Both members and staff could help improve this."

The toilets had little to no toilet paper. The toilets and the sinks were filthy.Where are the cleaning facilities to wipe down equipment after use.The place was so busy the air was hot and thick. Which leads to my next concern what's the fire drill for the faculty. There was 99 people and one stairway with 2 people at a time to get out to the exit. What is the plan in a fire. There was no staff around and I was there with my daughter to try the facility first before getting membership but at last the pin didn't work so I was left to have to buy a membership. Which I haven't been able to view what is what or change any of the plans as the app keeps closing. It's all extremely frustrating I've deleted and redown loaded the app with no joy and talking to other ls it's not just me it's slow.

Chris C,2025-02-28T02:11:48.000Z,1,Web site took my money. Customer services refused to put it right.,"My daughter and i wanted to go and use the local gym for a trial session. We did make a slight mistake in not noticing that weekend opening hours were different from weekday. The web site allowed us to book for a gym which was closed.When we got there and found it closed, we drove to the next town over and tried there as it's 24/7...not valid because our day trial was for a specific branch. We couldn't even pay for a session in the other gym because that would be two concurrent memberships in different branches.I contacted customer services and a day or two later, they replied saying No Refunds. Clearly, any refunds policy is irrelevant if the web site sells a ticket for a service the company is not going to be delivering. It's not worth the cost of lodging a claim, so I'll just write it off as a bad job.They did offer me a credit to be used at a future date, but I have to let them know 24 hours in advance. Also, I think they've told me everything I need to know to conclude I don't want to give them any more money."
tammy,2025-02-28T02:00:37.000Z,1,Poor experience,"I am disappointed with the customer service and class cancellation policy at PureGym, particularly at the Kidbrooke branch. The policy of restricting class access if you cancel within 4 hours makes little sense, especially when morning classes often have fewer than six participants. It feels unreasonable to be penalized for a last-minute cancellation when the class is practically empty.When I reached out to express my concerns, I received a response from Mike that felt rude and lacked empathy. This experience has left me questioning PureGym’s approach to customer care and the rigidity of its policies.I hope PureGym will review its policies and provide additional training to ensure customer interactions are handled with more understanding and respect."

Instead they forced me to speak with the bank in order to cancel the subscription. Despite of making the request to the bank, I've been charged extra for the by the PureGym saying that it's resubmission fee. You simply can't add resubmission fee to user when you ask the users to cancel the subscription from the bank instead from your website or from the app. They are nothing but a bunch of scammer who are just trying to make few bucks, shame on themselves..Additionally, I'd also like to point out that their app doesn't even works properly because when I tried to cancel my membership at the last step, instead of getting my membership cancelled the app again refreshed into the membership page. I wonder who the company explains their incapability and irresponsibility."

The room upstairs where classes are held is disgusting. There is public hair and bitten off nails on the floor. They have been there for at least 10 days, there is no one atound to report it to  There is never anything to wipe the machines down, no hand wash or toilet paper. The toilet paper is all in balls around the sink and splatted on mirrors. It's full of children strutting around like they are in a nightclub.  No staff around. The machines are normally full of people taking photos of themselves. The showers are pathetic and the water is cold. There has been a pair of knickers left to 1 side for at least a week. It has gone down hill badly and quickly."

Maria,2025-03-03T09:32:57.000Z,1,"Sexual assault, Bullying, Threats and Cover Ups","I had hoped to attach video of a PureGym London Southgate staff meeting, alas that is not the case.As a member, myself and others have been unjustly penalised, threatened, bullied and assaulted amongst many other things. Be warned, off-site staff do not care about the public and neither do many of their on-site gym staff.The London Regional and Cluster managers may try to strong-arm you into a meeting whilst avoiding speaking with you directly via email. You may receive emails signed “Head Office”, then have any subsequent request to speak directly with anyone from Head Office ignored. When your goal is simply to share a plethora of evidence.Should you make a subject access request, they may well claim data was accidentally deleted. Toxicity seems to be endemic to their work culture, with little to no attempts at rectification.If you are sexually assaulted, expect attempts to silence you. Have a quick look on Twitter if you're in doubt.Just don’t go here. ---Update: Thank you Customer b and I'm also so sorry about your experiences. It's such a shame to see the recent reviews pouring in. I know this has all been going on for a very long time.Many have echoed your sentiments. PTs who make a job out of being around members. Most likely in the hopes of new friends or clients. Then go on to treat them terribly, habitually. Your review really upsets me, again I'm so sorry.I agree that many of them seem to have a mistaken sense of ownership over the gym. I also do believe Cgbodyboost is a bully who seems to enjoy upsetting people. She's definitely not the only one. Though she has been at the centre of so many issues, particularly with women. Her ex member friend turned collegue who's in short shorts on the website for God knows what reason, is more covert, but almost as bad. You know when people are so similar but can't be friends because they don't like each other, that usually says it all. There are a few who are problematic. I'm so sorry for how she treated you and you would also have had my full support. They seem to think PTs who are overgrown mean girls or who participate in sexual deviancy using work as their playground are A-OK, and their behaviour should be covered up.It's disgusting, especially when they have a duty of care for the public.  I do hope more people will share their experiences. From what I've heard and seen, it's been a whole lot of toxic nonsense for a very long time.I believe Head Office are aware of what we've discussed. If they are not, that is the responsibility of their subordinates. They have a long list of complaints from myself. At the very least it's someone's job to review these reviews. They know.I'm so sick of the abhorrently poor treatment of myself and others. They do not seem to even understand the gravity of how they've treated people and how they behave. I was really hoping things would change. If this behaviour does not change, I will give the go ahead to publicise everything. Enough is enough."

If I was going to pay extra for a personal trainer I wouldn’t pay for a gym membership on top and I’m not qualified to work out what machine I should be using for how long to achieve what I want to achieve plus it’s dangerous. Reception desk was hidden inside behind equipment instead of being at the front to greet people. All very strange.

The cost of off peak membership is £20 pm well worth it as the equipment is well maintained and access is easy during the day. The classes are included in the fee."

You have no direct access to any membership options besides upgrading, and good luck if you have a tech issue. Emails are sent out without the right links, so even if you wanted to book a PT you can't!! Get a move on and do something about it. Add some more good people in customer services and invest on some IT for goodness sake!!!!! We don't have time to be faffing about every little thing!!!"

I Always leave Liams classes feeling super positive and with a smile on my face. Great chap! Liam is an approachable PT and always goes above and beyond for any gym goer, whether that be in the class or outside the class.I really look forward to Liam's classes, especially with his constant positive affirmations and motivation, makes me feel really proud of what I have achieved so far. I have also attended other classes with Megan and Lee, who are also friendly and very encouraging, I always feel very good after their classes, and that i have pushed my self. In fact every PT at the gym, that I have been in contact with are super helpful and give great tips and advice when needed and are all very friendly.I only have one negative which are the mats in the studio, they are really dirty, and I come away with grubby leggings after using them after each session, and they have actually caused my skin to breakout (when using the mats for mind classes or stretching). I believe they should be cleaned more often."

He immediately put me at ease and took his time to walk me around explaining every aspect including the benefits of the various pieces of equipment in relation to my goal (which he enquired about at the start). He provided me with every assurance I needed, without any hint of sales pressure. I left uninterested in visiting any other gym came home and completed the simple and straightforward application online."

The date this happened was the 21st of February at 09.30. The PT let them in and the manager authorised it.

The equipment is too cramped in some places on gym floor. You have to stop your leg press for someone to get past. The chest press was clunky. There are no windows to open which i find strange. Standing in the pod to go in and out is disgusting especially when someone smells of sweat and is unhygienic. I can still smell it when im standing there. Lots of people dont book into the class. So there were spaces left but when i booked on and went, it was absolutely rammed. Wasnt enjoyable. Some of the classes are same format as les mills from 15 years ago. The guy doing stretch class just decided he didnt want to take it one day. But actually came stayed and chatted instead to the members (?). Then the next time i tried the stretch class, he just did half the class instead of the fullhour. I need to find a serious gym"

You can't upgrade an off peak to a core membership, you need to speak to a member of staff... How do you do that? Nowhere on the site is there an option to contact support, no online support chat? The higher ups need wake up and fix this awful sign up experienceOh and there's not even a way to cancel through the website or app, you just have to manually cancel the direct debit, I have no idea how a company in this age can make such a shoddy subscription service, especially a business as popular and established as pure gym."

Anthony Trainer,2025-02-18T13:43:22.000Z,1,Underhanded cancel culture,"I was a long standing member of over a decade at puregym paisley until i received an email informing me that a member of staff had made a complaint about me and my membership and subsequent access to the gym was being suspended while an investigation was carried out concerning these ""incidents"". Days later i recieved another email stating that my account was permanently suspended. When i asked for an explanation of what i was suposed to have done wrong i was told, by the then manager, that they had dealt with the "" incidents"" under the ""safe space"" policy recently added to the updated terms and conditions at puregym and that to preserve this safe space concept they couldn't divulge any information on what i was supposed to have done to ""who"" or what. I still dont know what i done wrong. The ""safe ""space policy was, in my view, used to conduct a kangaroo court in my absence that denied me the right to face my complainer and refused me the basic right to defend myself. This type of policy is a "" cancel culture"" tool that is allowing gym employees to ""police"" the paying gym membership any way that suits them. I sent emails to puregym head office and was refered back to the gym manager who refused to let me in the door and wouldn't come out of his office and sent a girl out wearing a ""trainee"" badge on her shirt to tell me that he wasn't in. I sat in the coffee house directly across from the gym and saw the manager 5 minutes later sparring with a female gym member.Most of the instructors at paisley would fail a drugs test, especially at weekends. The air conditioning is reduced to a damaging level at all times.all of the televisions are kept off. The staff are allowed to vape inside, and smoke at the entrance to the gym. The male members think that they alone have the exclusive rights to pursue female gym members romantically. The instructors are unapproachable for help and advice unless you are paying them as a PT. I have witnessed all of this at paisley. I have intervened many times when people where using the equipment wrong and stopping people from injuring themselves when so called instructors have deliberately looked the other way. They have no interest i helping people or giving advice unless you are paying them."

The equipment was average, nothing special, and the overall hygiene was poor. The entire gym smelled bad, making workouts unpleasant, and while the showers looked clean, they still smelled awful - likely due to the type of people using them (I’ll let you read between the lines).To top it off, their refund process is a complete joke. I requested a refund 20 days ago, and I’m still waiting. Despite multiple emails, they keep delaying and making excuses instead of simply returning my money. At this point, it feels like they’re dragging it out on purpose.Avoid this gym if you expect basic hygiene and decent customer service. PureGym is cheap for a reason."

The cable machines while being used, are dangerous to walk through, someone is going to get hurt. Over the last week, i have seen so many people 'collide' with each other, while one person is using the cable machines, and the other person is walking to the drink machine or ladies changing room.  Also there is no marked out 'pathway' inside the gym to walk 'safely' around the gym or to get from A to B safely.  The new refurb is in my opinion, poorly planned. Poorly designed."

At best, this is poor customer relations, at worst it is theft."

Dave,2025-02-16T09:24:06.000Z,3,"Gyms are okay, bathrooms are disgusting","I have access to 3 gyms in my area, and generally speaking I would say that the equipment is good although they constantly move it around the rooms, once a week. You can never find what you want because they’re constantly rearranging the equipment. No reason whatsoever, absolutely no idea why they do it. Also, they don’t seem to understand what people use, so one of the least popular machines is the leg curl and there are two of those, and one of the most popular machines is the leg extension and there is *one* of those. Pretty stupid. But much worse is the fact that the state of the bathrooms in all of the gyms I attend is shocking. It is always shocking. One of them has had no hot water for months, so I’m reduced to a cold shower, but all of the bathrooms are filthy, they stink, one of the bathrooms has a constant smell of sewage under the floor, the toilets are a mess, and there is rubbish everywhere. I know that customers are probably complete animals these days, but the fact is the management needs to keep the bathrooms completely spick and span. I actually worry about catching a disease there, they are so filthy and disgusting."

customer,2025-02-14T21:08:27.000Z,1,So I am a Puregym plus member,"So I am a Puregym plus member. My home gym is in Portsmouth, which i joined when I was working in the area. I actually live in Essex but I paid for the plus membership as I work in different parts of the country, thinking this would allow me to use gyms where I might be working. This week I was working in Devizes, Wiltshire and went to the Trowbridge Puregym, a ½ drive, but couldn't access the gym due to membership restrictions. I was allowed in though to workout. The following day I went to the Chippenham Puregym, and had the same problem. This time I wasn't allowed in as I was told if something happened, I wouldn't be covered by their insurance, even though I'm a Puregym member? I had to buy a day pass for £10.99, using a different email address to the one I use for my Puregym membership already, as it would cause a problem. On top of that, I was training shoulders and they didn't have a side lateral machine!!Apparently this is all down to in some Puregyms the membership is more expensive than others, and if you go to one that is more expensive, you can't use it. Having to then pay £10.99 just to use that gym for one day seems very unreasonable? My monthly payment was due shortly after these gym visits so I couldn't change my home gym to allow me to use these gyms as part of my membership. I think Puregym need to address this issue?"

Simon Snook,2025-02-14T19:47:08.000Z,1,Wouldn't waste your time/money,"Went there with a day pass, one their day pass price is more expensive than other gyms. Two the gym I went to (Rayleigh) was awful they only have one machine for each movement so your waiting around for a long time for other people to finish their workout. The olympic weights are minimal people taking them off other machines and asking if people are using them as it's very limited to what they have. Three there was no signs to say the gym continues up the stairs, the only sign they have is saying studio and changing rooms upstairs. The last thing is all their leg machines are up stairs apart from the leg press... What gym puts legs upstairs after a hard session you then have to navigate the stairs to leave. In short the gym is small, limited weights and machines and gym layout in my opinion is wrong."

Their customer service is a nightmare - there's no phone support, no instant messaging, and even their Facebook responses take ages. I might as well be sending messages into a void!The pricing structure is deliberately misleading. They lure you in with their 'Plus' membership, but once you actually visit certain locations, you suddenly discover they're not included. When you try to resolve this through their confusing app or website, you hit a wall. Their solution? Pay extra for day passes! Even worse, after paying these additional fees, you discover the location is closed on weekends - yet they still expect you to pay for those days!The most infuriating part? They market themselves as a 24-hour gym chain, but their 'premium' London locations aren't even open on weekends. This is completely false advertising. I've never experienced such a blatant disconnect between marketing promises and reality. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this gym at all costs"

Shamim Ahmed,2025-02-12T11:46:54.000Z,2,Improvements needed,"I have been a member of this PureGym ever since it opened. I have returned after a long break and here are my thoughts:1. There is a massive odour problem. As soon as you enter the floor you are met with a stench of stale body odour making it difficult to breathe. The air circulation needs to improve.2. Self employed personal trainers failing to lead by example. I witness one constantly running from one end of floor to another. This is a health and safety risk, why is there a need to run here? Also why is it the self employed PTs are no longer wearing PureGym uniform?3. I see members receiving trainjng from other members. I thought this wasn't allowed. Staff turn a blind eye.4. Members failing to return equipment and clean after themselves. It is really disgusting to come to euipment that has sweat stains or sweat dripping."

My local PureGym seems clean enough. The bathrooms are not great but they are not much used. I am giving one star for the lack of customer service and policies on payments. By mistake I had no funds in my bank accounts. My bank advised me of the  incoming PureGym direct debit and I immediately funded my accounts but still my payment failed. PureGym blocked my membership and wants to charge me 20£ to resubmit the Direct Debit which is an automated process and usually financial institutions do not charge corporate customer extra for this. I can pay immediately manually but still need to pay a charge of 5£. Wrote to customer service 24 hours ago asking to wave the 5£ charge as a relationship gesture but no answer. you cannot contact them by phone.

This is where they conned me. Apparently I can't go to crystal peaks gym. So basically my home gym is town which is 100% pointless. If I had put crystal peaks as my home gym and probably paid an extra £1 a month I would have access to crystal peaks gym and all other in Sheffield centre. You horrible disgusting company.Yo swap my gym to crystal means I'll be paying more money rn and my monthly bill goes up. Waste of my time. I don't think I'll ever go to PureGym ever again once my monthly sub is up. Con artists.avois.

The balance went to 0. It still asked me to supply my bank details which I did and then I've now been charged for the day pass I would like a refund. This is ridiculous. Don't advertise things that Clearly your system is acknowledging that it should be zero but you still went ahead and charged me the full price of the daily membership and if it wasn't free, I wouldn't have tried to do it so I really would like a refund and I'm not even gonna attend because it's kind of offputting. You don't have systems that work. You don't have a contact email. You don't have a contact phone number you don't have any kind of customer facing help. You have a few questions that you answer, but that isn't sufficient for the situation that isn't part of what you've put on there so it's really useless All in all big waste of time now I have to ask my bank for a refund."

RICHIE,2025-02-08T14:34:54.000Z,4,Pure Gym Dunfermline is vastly improved…,Pure Gym Dunfermline is vastly improved since the recent re-fit with better availability of kit and more organised space. Don’t think the staff get the most out of the patrons and are not visible for members not engaged in a personal training session. Would be good if they spent time advising and correcting on poor/ ineffective techniques. This would also lead naturally to more business for personal trainers (a basic approach that seems to have escaped the staff at Dunfermline). More time improving knowledge and technique of those attending gym would be better. The staff do not seem to encourage good behaviours whilst using the kit as people are often witnessed spending extended rest periods on their mobile devices whilst using kit. Wrong culture which could be influenced by more experienced/enthusiastic and engaged staff.

I wouldn’t recommend this gym to go and train, the village gym and laboratory might be better long term."

Since Christmas there is insufficient cover for the 6.15am class on Fridays. A couple of classes were moved to 7.15am which is too late for most of us attending the early classes, one was cancelled, but today it was scheduled go ahead but no trainer turned up. Very frustrating for those of us who made the effort to be there and ended up doing our own thing instead."

Had to email member services who just said wait up to 14 days for our refund and try again.  No follow through or offer to resolve.  They had my money and DD details but I could not access the gym. In common with other reviews PureGym seem to have IT issues.Member services - please don't say I should contact you; you didn't offer any service.

Martin Frost,2025-02-07T07:27:54.000Z,3,PureGym Lite,"Prior to Alfreton PureGym opening my membership included 311 sites across the UK. It’s needed as I travel up and down the country throughout the week. Alfreton is currently closer to my main base though so the convenience is good for me, but I had to pay an extra £7 (£34 a month) to access it. To my disappointment it is more a PureGym Lite than a full PureGym experience. No dedicated changing rooms, no hydration station, limited equipment and very little space. The location is good, but to charge what they charge is hard to stomach when places like CastleMarina is four times as big and costs less.Going forward they need to bring the price down, and put in an hydration station. After all, what’s the point of the + membership if you don’t even have the basics of a real PureGym experience."

Maz,2025-02-08T14:34:18.000Z,5,Wesley T Professional Trainer - The hidden Gem in London St Pauls,"There are trainers and there are professional trainers who know structure, form and strength.  It is an art form to be able to train and conduct a class.  He cares for all people in the class and adds a personal training touch to each individual.  I have been attending Pure Gym for nearly a year.  He is the stand out trainer.  All the classes are very good but it is his way of training, there is no ego.  His technical knowledge in regards to muscle and weight training is very advance.  His classes have structure, form and flow - the exercises run into each other seamlessly.  The whole body is worked in a format that is balanced.  He is very experienced, consistent and reliable.  What you see with Wesley is what you get -  A trainer who has a heart, is meticulously professional and a cut above everyone else.  An asset to the Gym. I have never had an injury and my body shape has changed and become stronger, leaner - slow and steady is his method.  Wesley's friendly approach and work ethic makes everyone feel welcome and at ease.  Don't be fooled you are there to work.  I hope his classes continue. I have learnt so much.  Thank you.

So I have to create a new email address that isn't associated to an existing account so I can buy a day pass. Also if THAT email has been used to buy a day pass it won't work either because there's now an account associated to that email. You guys are turning down so much income because your IT guys haven't taught your site to recognise the difference between existing members and accounts that bought a day pass 2 years ago."

Ayo Johnson,2025-02-06T19:10:30.000Z,4,I gave a great review because I love…,"I gave a great review because I love the gym, the members and it's staff. I've given a few useful pointers to try to help improve things here and there but the sad truth is they're always pushed aside for fear of upsetting anyone. We need a seated calf raise machine, I've been asking for this for 2 years with no result. We have two dedicated glute raise machines upstairs and two resting boards downstairs solely for glute raises in the gym which makes me wonder if glutes are a newly discovered body part. A seated calf raise is a small machine that is very useful but we still can't get one. In addition to this Pure gym prides itself on being a safe place to train. Day after day I go in and see someone has pushed the flat and decline bench press machines all the way to the wall which makes it impossible to spot someone on the bench, and it doesn't leave enough space for the weights to be put back. I've pointed this out more times than I can remember but nothing has been done. How can it be a safe gym if you can't spot someone while bench pressing? Does this make sense? Maybe I'm old fashioned. Lastly the signs asking members to replace weights are useless because the problem remains. A sign at the entrance asking for consideration to fellow members will not offend or scare any new comers away. In fact it will re assure them that this is a safe gym in which mutual consideration for each other is a priority. The question I have is will any one be ""brave"" enough to implement these simple changes?"
Betrina,2025-02-06T13:50:57.000Z,4,I've been going to PureGym Redditch,"I've been going to PureGym Redditch, and overall, it’s a fantastic gym. The place is spacious, with a good vibe, decent music, and plenty of equipment to work with. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the manager deserves a shout-out for being great. However, hygiene could be better – it would be nice if more members cleaned up after themselves and if cleaning stations were brought back. A few more machines focused on lower body exercises would be a welcome addition too. Still, for the price, it's solid and worth recommending. Giving it 4 stars!"

agooch,2025-02-04T01:52:46.000Z,1,A real review about Puregym Woolwich,"A real review about Puregym WoolwichThis is probably one of the worst reviewed Puregym. Management WERE nice however gone down hill with lacking skills, some staff think they better than everyone else,are rude and not welcoming at all, it doesn’t take much of an effort to smile or say hello as you are the face of Puregym. Certain male Staff/manager have harassed women for their phone number and to be physical with them or threatened to get banned! Puregym Head office needs to be made aware as some women do not come here for this reason. Disgusting!Large open gym however not enough equipment to go around especially if there are too many members in at the same time. Yes, could look at the app to see how many members are in the gym however if I do this everyday after work then I will not be able to come gym as its busy everyday other than the weekend. There should be a limit of people at any one time. Changing rooms are ok, however can get smelly and dirty.  it should be mandatory to bring your own towel to put on benches/machines instead of leaving your disgusting body sweat on the equipment and walking off. It should also be mandatory for any gym that members to wear appropriate gym footwear, and not flipflops or crocs and staff will not tell those members (if they are members) A couple of faulty machines have been reported but not fixed or repaired (over 4 weeks), it has been bought to management attention.Groups of boys/children hogging a few benches at the same time even though they do the same exercise. Couple of members decide to do a super-set exercise and state they are using the bench, lat pull down and cable machine at once and think they own the gym, this should not be allowed, it’s a gym for everyone.As per a previous review about members bothering other members. I agree….. this is a place where people should be able to come, exercise in your own space and go home, not stare at women and think this is Hinge or a Speed dating venue ! It isn’t a place where someone can exercise in peace without being approached or hit on.There are some nice regular members who make it bearable and happy to share and help.People use this gym as a crossfit gym which it is not and not designed for. Groups of kids hogging equipment and thinking they are part of a Strongman competition or acrobats. Very busy between 3pm and 9pm and has been since the gym opened.A pair of members train at this gym nearly everyday, hog two benches, and lots of free weights so no one can use them and then setup infront of the fire exit! Why is management or staff not telling them this is a hazard if there was a fire? Because the assistant manager doesnt want confrontation. The owner or mystery shoppers should come to this gym to witness everything first hand."

cs978,2025-02-03T20:09:03.000Z,2,"Too busy, not a nice environment","The gym has a good selection of equipment but unfortunately it’s very difficult to use as this gym is very busy the majority of the time. There are often groups of 5 or 6 young men moving around the gym together, taking over the space that you’re exercising in so you end up having to move. Randomly boxing each other and pushing each other around next to you whilst you’re trying to exercise. Equipment is never put back which isn’t the staff’s fault but is frustrating trying to find what you need. Ever since the changing rooms were refurbished a few years ago there has been a rotten smell coming from the sinks in the women’s changing rooms. At one point it seemed to take over that entire side of the gym. It’s also filthy in the gym the majority of the time. There are 4 pure gyms south of Nottingham city centre but only one north. We need some more pure gyms around this area as this one is far too crowded. I’ve been a member since 2018 but I’ll be cancelling my membership now."

The hygiene standards are poor, with broken and leaking male and female toilets. The soap dispensers have been broken for over six months, and nobody has replaced or repaired them. The walls are damaged and dirty, and the floor is absolutely unacceptable. I only go there because it’s just 10 minutes from my home. This gym used to be packed, but now it's mostly empty. The only people who seem to frequent it are teenage kids aged 13-15, who shouldn’t be there, but Pure Gym allows them because there are no staff members present to enforce the rules. There’s only one assistant manager who is hard to approach. If you ask him to do something or voice a complaint, he gets upset and is unhelpful. Pure Gym really needs to either close this location and make necessary repairs or improve the hygiene standards, as it poses a danger to health."

For such a large gym, 1 or 2 peices of equiptment for a lot of the machines is shockingly bad. The lay out of the gym also unfortunately a not great. As an example of the leg press machine is in use... With a cue(which has happend more than once to me) you have to walk through the, functional area, past the CV area, past a studio, past the changing rooms, past the front doors, to the plate loaded leg press machine... To find that also on use. I then have to walk all the way back to where I started to try and piece togther alternative options for my work out. Don't get me wrong it's first world problems but it's super annoying and the first gym I've had this problem in... I train at at 5.30am so it shouldn't be a problems that time. It's just very dissapointing."

Mr Alan Patterson,2025-02-02T11:12:21.000Z,5,Rejoining,I've used Blyth since it opened but cancelled it due to health problems which are now hopefully resolved and the offer gives me the chance to try again at little initial cost

Gaurav,2025-02-02T08:13:45.000Z,1,Targeted Biased/Money/Identity theft,"I have been member of the puregym idle for as long as it first opened around 2015-16, I have got direct debit every month since then for me and my 3 family members, Recently went to gym after 3-4 months and when trying to put pin , it wasn’t working, there wasn’t anyone there to help, Even I couldn’t log into the app, It was frustrating and took a but of time finding online and contacted them through messenger,It said someone will reply back within 12 hrs and evn 20 hrs went by and no one responded, Even did emails, still no reply, Then reply came that my membership has been suspended for something happened in 8 dec 24 and most likely I think I didn’t even go to gym as I was travelling abroad for last few months, I rarely go to this gym as I have got membership of other gym groups also. The real annoying thing is they didn’t inform or anything and kept taking payments from account and after 2-3 months I went to gym and you get to know when I just kept paying for it as it is quite cheap and couldn’t bother cancelling it, I am a NHS Dentist and due quite busy schedule don’t able to go daily and only usually go few times a month, but recently some health issues I don’t go . This is really annoying to know how they treat a legacy and loyal member like that, I feel biased in that place sometimes also.I actually want to report and take this matter further and want to have this investigated and possibly gather evidence and look into this practice of theirs as they might have been doing this to others also, but people usually don’t put voice out.The people responsible should be named and shamed for this.All in all It’s actually gone really down in quality and gym usability than before.My friend has managed to get the card from gym and no. of one of the gym manager and texted them, But no response has come from there yet.I will go and visit and possibly try to find the area manager guy I met few months ago, He was a lovely asian person. My family members membership is still active, but they also go rarely.Al in all it’s not good anymore, I would advise people to look elsewhere. David Lloyd and Jd gums are much better than this.Avoid this place if possible."

Whoever is the manager of this place is completely useless. Sometimes things don’t work and take months for it to be fixed and so many of the cycles in the cycle studio do not work like they do not show the rpm or they are broken or shaking and not stable!! They finally at least changed the parking company from UKPC who were scammers to Euro Car Park

Galmangoda,2025-02-01T20:01:44.000Z,5,Recommended,"Today, I visited the Sutton branch, and I wanted to share my positive experience with personal trainer John Imani. He was incredibly helpful—he took the time to give me a thorough tour, including the car park, and covered all areas of the gym. He also provided me with plenty of useful information and tips.When I last visited the Pure gym Sutton branch a few years ago, the staff member wasn’t very helpful, which led me to go elsewhere. However, today John’s assistance made all the difference, and I’ve decided to join the Sutton branch."
